###[Learn You Some Game Maker!](https://github.com/Ceryni/LYSGM/wiki)
Really the only purpose I know this will have without a doubt is for me to collect all the things I find during my journey for learning how to make games with GMS. If you find some use for this or if you'd like to add to my list for some reason, just [create a github issue](https://github.com/Ceryni/LYSGM/issues/new) and I'll add it. There is some process stuff I could do to allow pull requests for the wiki but I just don't see this becoming big enough to merit it at this point. If it does I can always do it later.
